The origins of this plant seem to be in line with an Afghani ancestry; combining that with the MNS Skunk line make the F1 seeds excellent value, particularly regarding the more medicinally valued plants (used for many medical ailments including pain management, MS, arthritis and depression). The yields that a grower of this strain should expect for indoor cultivation should be between at least 500-650 grams per square meter. It depends upon the style of growing and the selection of the plant.  Since it is predominantly indica, this plant does not stretch much and can be grown quite easily by beginning to advanced growers with good results. The flower cluster can be very dense, and as the plant draws closer to maturity, it should be monitored for mould if the humidity is moderate to high during the last weeks of the plants life. We found that the majority of the plants are finished after 7 weeks flowering with a very small percentage taking a week to 10 days more.

Ed Rosenthal Super Bud's amazingly succulent flower formation is the strain's distinguishing feature. Different individuals show extra Sativa or Indica influence through subtle variations in the development and structure of their resin-soaked buds. Otherwise, phenotype variation is small, with a majority of plants flowering at the same speed and increasing their height by about 150%. A small proportion will show a jump at the onset of blooming, which first widens the gaps between internodes and later gives an even greater yield potential. All females exhibit a flower structure bursting with Indica density that is made even fatter with the running Sativa tendency, resulting in buds that swell upwards and outwards to crazy sizes. A strong and incredibly sweet aroma of pineapple-punch is the dominant flavour across the strain. The Sativa-leaning females make great multi-stem plants and produce huge oval calyxes which spiral into crooked bud-pyramids large enough to bend branches. The Indica phenotype's flowers are distinct and impressive, building into voluptuous columns of snowy bud with main colas as thick as an arm.

It is the result of crossing the best sativa and the best indica clones from Dinafem&rsquo;s mother plants.Moby Dick is Dinafem&rsquo;s most psychoactive strain with up to 21% THC and a higher than average THCV content.   THCV is present in equatorial sativas in response to the sun&rsquo;s ultraviolet rays.  It strengthens the effects of the THC.The low CBD concentration helps to make the effect psycho-actively intense and long-lasting.

Now finding something special is attainable with less trial and error work.The best thing to do is to narrow things down to a maximum of 12 weeks, so plants that take longer should be discarded. Lower food levels may be advisable, but it will depend upon the type of grow medium and setup you have.The flavors held in this hybrid will be like biting into a rainbow...almost everything you ever tasted will dance upon the senses, and its effect will astound. It really would help those Medical growers who go the extra yard to find a tailor made medicine.Yields of 450 -650 grams would be the expected but if this plant is grown in a greenhouse or outdoors then give it space as it will blow you away, leaving the air around it feeling claustrophobic. This hybrid will have phenotypes in it that can be finished in 10 weeks, but most will go an extra week or two. In an outdoor grow in the northern hemisphere it will be ready mid to late October.

Besides having an impressive coat of resin and powerful Indica psychoactivity, White Widow stands out due to its strong flavour : spicy and fruity with a dash of bitterness. It has wide, dark green leaves, moderate growth with a height that is easy to control and important medicinal value. In 60 days, a unique taste and effect are produced.  White Widow is one of the best strains of Cannabis ever produced and its high CBD content, together with other Cannabinoids, have helped it gain its worthy fame for being very appropriate for medicinal uses.Its partner is an AK47 which has also been specially selected for its excellent aromatic and therapeutic properties, as well as for its strength and heavy yield. This selection stands out due to its heavy harvest, outstretched leaves, light green colour, and it&rsquo;s sweet, fruity, sativa taste, added to a powerful effect thanks to a high proportion of THC compared to its CBD content.Apart from its vigorous growth, this AK 47 has also transmitted to its White Siberian descendants a characteristically sweet aroma and intense effect, somewhat physical and quite cerebral, which is greatly appreciated by medicinal users thanks to its long-lasting effect.To summarise the characteristics of the new White Siberian mentioning the best features of the genotypes that it is composed of: a vigorous, medium to high sized Indica-Sativa hybrid with a very good indoor harvest and extremely resistant outdoors.

However, there is another fundamental characteristic that makes it such an appreciated variety: its wonderful, unique flavour.A combination of spices, incense, sandalwood, pepper and hints of lemon, with a strong aftertaste; this is the luxury that can be obtained from this delicious genetic breed.  Some time ago, Dinafem came across a very high quality sativa Haze, thanks to JYD.  It was of the best quality: 12 week flowering, extraordinary taste, very complex, persistent...in short, delicious.  Furthermore, the strain has an effect that without a doubt is the most extreme of all our selection of mother-plants.It can be defined as energetic, very psychoactive. On some occasions, it can be very intense and overpowering, and disappears without leaving a relaxed feeling due to a low CBD content.Therefore, Dinafem had its taste and effect and also its resistance to fungus. What better partner for the highly productive Critical+, which has proved to be an authentic F&oacute;rmula-1 for commercial production? Dinafem used the sativa as the mother plant in order to obtain its special flavour, and at the same time the highest psychoactivity possible, achieving a result to be proud of: a percentage of the plants developed an extremely special flavour as a result of the mixture with the fruity flavour of the Critical+, apart from having a reasonably rapid growth -10 weeks to maturity.  The haze genetics contained in this variety obviously make it highly resistant to mildew, and therefore it is adequate for cultivating in cold wet areas where plants can be affected by fungus.  The combination of resistance, productivity, strength and taste in the SCH, turn it into a first-class variety.  It is extremely vigorous and will give enormous buds covered in thick crystals of resin with an incredible aroma to juicy fruit chewing gum and an active effect which is totally overpowering.",,"JYD Haze x Critical +","Mostly Sativa","60 - 75 days",Photoperiod,Feminised,"12 - 19%",Unknown,,"Grows outdoors",,,,,https://tiger-one.eu/en/categories/feminised-cannabis-seeds/super-critical-haze-feminised-seeds,http://tiger-one.eu/media/catalog/product/s/u/supercriticalhaze_00.jpg,http://tiger-one.eu/media/catalog/product/s/u/supercriticalhaze_01.jpg,"Dinafem, Wholesale Cannabis Seeds, Feminised Cannabis Seeds"

Critical+ is obviously the dominant part in the crossbreed, which matures slightly later but in exchange has greatly improved its flavour and effect. The quantity and size of the resin produced by this hybrid much surpasses that of Critical+, while the flavour includes more tones than that of its mythically productive predecessor, which is now a reference due to its intense flavour.Another clear consequence is its growing vigour, which has increased markedly. This hybrid tends to grow in the form of a Christmas tree, with long branches, all stemming from the main trunk.  A small amount of these plants flower somewhat later due to the Haze genetics.

Automatic feminised varieties have several advantages above  light cycle dependent feminised varieties:Auto Blueberry is  ready for harvest in about ten weeks and the plants grow outdoors for only a short period. They don't  grow tall and are well concealed. For the  same reason it is possible to harvest outdoors two or three times per season,  depending on the latitude. At Northern latitudes it is a very attractive  alternative for an early summer crop, while in Mediterranean climates two or  three harvests per season are not uncommon. In every aspect Auto Blueberry is a  true cosmopolitan. Indoors this variety is an amazing alternative to growing from clones.As an automatic  genetic source Dutch Passion have used Canadian Ruderalis genetics.&nbsp; Backcrossing till the F4 generation resulted in Auto Blueberry to become 100%  automatic.&nbsp; The F4 auto-flowered 100%, 25 days after germination of the seeds.  &nbsp;Dutch Passion Auto Blueberry seeds (F5) were produced by selfing the  F4.The plants still  carry most of the Blueberry characteristics, so the phenotype is distinctive  Blueberry.

The plants are taller and like to branch out making them ideal for ""training"", i.e. tying back or bending over. Indoors, the plants are fully mature by week seven of the flowering cycle. Outdoors, under optimum conditions the plant is a super-producer capable of being multi-harvested over a period of time. Branch-end buds ripening by the beginning of October are harvested and new buds form and mature about every ten days after and can be harvested through the end of November, or however long the plant can be kept alive, making Flo ideal for greenhouse production. Deep purple hues darken the buds the more they mature. The motivational high produced by the Flo is quite unique and long-lasting.

It can grow just over 1 m tall but we advise growers to either pinch or top the plant to produce more of a bushy plant.Since it will not grow much vertically, bushing the volume of the plant sideways can give better results for yield. We also recommend a week longer than normal in veg with Blue Mystic, again to maximise the yield. Normally, it will do 55-65 g per plant indoors.

However, the overall picture of all plants are very close to the original SPG clone.For this cross we selected many SweetChunk F1 plants and save two very good Male`s.At the end we decided us for a more Sativa and SPG dominant Male and did a backcross to the Sweet Pink Grapefruit clone. The growth of the first Backcross is in contrast to the Sweet Chunk F1 Generation more similar to the leaf shape much finer and more delicate. Also, the extension is no longer compare with the F1 hybrid. The whole plant form has changed and tends more to a similar growth like the SPG. The Sweet Chunk F1 hybrid was characterized by the dominance of the Deep Chunk which makes the cross very homogeneous and stable. Through the first backcross, there was a previously suspected splitting of the genes and hence also to more phenotypes in a Seedpack, where in all plants from the same overall picture forth the sweet pink grapefruit. There are three different phenotypes. One Deep Chunk pheno which is similar to the Sweet Chunk F1, with a lot of resin, compact buds and an more Indica look. The flavor from this Deep Chunk pheno is more hashy with a little fruity smell. The second pheno is an identical copy of the Sweet PinkGrapefruit Clone; a more sativa dominant growth, thick inflorescence and an intense smell - a perfect copy of Sweet Pink Grapefruit. The third and final phenotype has the same flavor as pheno two, but a little bit more Sativa dominant and needs to mature for a few days longer. The smell and taste can be easily compared with the second SPG phenotype but a little berry impact can be noticed too.

From this regular F1 generation two female and male plants were selected. These four Lemon Larry still form the basis of our OG.Kush strains. Alpine Seeds crossed their best male with their best female to produce an f2 generation. Seeds from this first Inbred generation were sent to private testers.Among them was an Austrian grower who selected the f2 line and crossed each strain again with an OG.Kush-LemonLarry F3 generation resulting. He tested this F3 generation and selected the best Lemon Larry phenos and crossed them again to inbreed them. The F4 seeds were sent back to Alpine Seeds. From this fourth generation Alpine Seeds selected again from a large number of plants and crossed the best two male and female to produce an F5 Inbreed line. From this F5 we selected a strong male and crossed it with the first OG.Kush-Lemon Larry from the selected ""elite Genetics"" batch (P1).The ""Lemon Larry OG.Kush-IBL"" is the result from this backcross.We considered whether we are really long, the resulting ""Lemon Larry"" should really be called Inbreedline because you can really only speak from an F7 or F8 from a pure IBL. But there are two reasons that warrant such a designation. The first is the stability and homogeneity of the plants itself. The second reason that we will continue to work at this plant is even better genetics to get to and around its own, completely new ""Lemon Larry"" to develop.The ""Lemon-OG.Kush Larry"" is growing very homogeneous, there are only two distinct phenotypes which are exclusively in height and slightly different in the flower structure. One phenomenon is the ""Lemon Larry“ who is growing a bit more compact and wide, almost like Indica leaves formed. The buds are tight and staggered off a very intense and strong odor, which is almost too strong, and also by several ziplock bags clearly visible.The second phenotype is growing something ""EastCoastSourDiesel"" Similarly, it is somewhat narrower leaves and not quite as hard and compact inflorescences. Even the aroma is a little more into diesel-like, but remains just as strong and intense as the ""Lemon Larry phenomenon"".The flowers and adjacent leaves are filled with many trichomes, considerably as the OG.Kush is in their power.The turn goes toward a more invigorating up-high's, but this is very strong in intensity and not for the novice smoker. At low doses the effect is invigorating and relaxing at the same time, what makes these genetics also very interesting for medical applications. Not for nothing is the ""OG.Kush"" the epitome of med varieties in the United States and Canada. The total average income is in the upper, it's like almost all Floor. Kush varieties or cuts not in a heavy-Yielders but the amount of high quality flowers for a OG.Kush is really good.The smell and the flavor is already something special. When smoke very lemony / sour, perhaps something diesel-like. As you breathe out, however, the typical and strong undertone kushige noticeable in the mouth, the taste will last a long time and can be really intense.These two features make the Lemon Larry is a very special sort, which can include a clear conscience to the best U.S. imports at all.",,"OG Kush - Lemon Larry F5 x OG Kush - Lemon Larry P1","Mostly Sativa","70-78 days",Photoperiod,Regular,,Unknown,Medium,,,,,,https://tiger-one.eu/en/categories/regular-cannabis-seeds/og-kush-lemon-larry-regular-seeds,http://tiger-one.eu/media/catalog/product/o/g/og.kush-lemonlarry_ibl_3_.jpg,http://tiger-one.eu/media/catalog/product/o/g/og.kush-lemonlarry_ibl_5_.jpg,"Alpine Seeds, Wholesale Cannabis Seeds, Regular Cannabis Seeds"
